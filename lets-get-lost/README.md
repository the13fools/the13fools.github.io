To develop: 

Download a text editor, sublime text is a good one (http://www.sublimetext.com/3).  We don't have administrative access, so get the portable version.

Resource loading causes some problems if you try to do it naively.  Instead, open a command prompt (powershell on windows, terminal on mac/unix systems), and type (assuming you have python installed): 

python -m SimpleHTTPServer
